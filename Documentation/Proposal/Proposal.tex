\chapter{System General Description}
\thispagestyle{fancy}
	\section{Problem Statement}
		\paragraph{}\ \ We will be writing a children's learning application as a progressive web application. The application will consist of numerous mini games that will align with the Oregon State Standards for Kindergarten.
		
		\paragraph{}\ \ The main interface will be a game map consisting of mini games along a path. The goal is to complete all mini games and rescue an animal at the end of the path. Once the user rescues an animal, the animal will be added to his or her “Animal Sanctuary”. The Animal Sanctuary represents the progress and achievements made by the user. The user will move to the next map after rescuing the animal. The difficulty of the mini games will increase, decrease, or remain the same depending on the user's mini game progress/success. A congratulatory splash screen will appear once all the maps have been completed. The user may play through the game as many times as he or she may like to continue to add animals to the sanctuary.
				
		\paragraph{}\ \ Upon launching the application, the user will have the option to create a user account, login to an existing account, or play the game without a user account. A user account will allow the user to create profiles and pick avatars to associate with these profiles. The user account tracks and saves the user's progress throughout the game. The user's animal collection will also be saved. In free play mode, the user's progress and animal collection are not saved. 
		
		\paragraph{}\ \ Users will not be required to login to the app before they can use it, but a login will be required to create multiple profiles and to move saves between different devices. The user will be able to create an account from within the application with only an email, which will be his or her username, and a password. Passwords will be encrypted before being sent from the client to the server.
		
		\paragraph{}\ \ Upon logging in or creating a new account, the choose profile page will appear. From this page, the user will be able to choose to continue an existing profile or to create a new profile.
				
		\paragraph{}\ \ The main menu will appear once the user selects a profile, or if they choose to play without an account. From the main menu, the user may choose “Play”, which takes them to the game map, or the user may select “Options” to customize game play. In the options menu, the user may toggle sound, set the difficulty level of the mini games, and filter mini games by subject.
				
		\paragraph{}\ \ User information that will be stored in the database includes the user's email (username), password, profile name, profile avatar, game progress and the animals collected. References to the game map images will be stored in the database as well. Mini game information including a reference to the game code, game data and statistics for the games will be located in the database. Lastly, the database will have the game's state stored in it as well.
		
	\section{Perspective}
	
		\subsection{History}
			\paragraph{}\ \ The idea for ‘To the Rescue!’ was a collaborative group effort that supports the abilities and interests of all group members. The ‘To the Rescue!’ project also provides opportunities for all members of the team to learn by experiencing new design and programming challenges. This project requires creativity and diversity to keep the content new and engaging. The developers wanted a project that would incorporate the interests of all members. This project also promotes education and can be extended to reach users of different ages and learning levels. 
		\subsection{Background}
			\paragraph{}\ \ Matthew Del Fante started programming two years ago and is proficient with the object-oriented and imperative programming paradigms. Programming languages that Matt is knowledgeable on include C++, C, C\#, JavaScript and QML.
			
			\paragraph{}\ \ Stephanie Vetter-Derosier has a background in early childhood and elementary education. She has been programming for two years and has experience in C++, C, C\#, Java, and QML. Stephanie had the opportunity to intern at a data analysis company in 2016. During her internship, she gained experience in project planning and development, Java, and automated software testing.
			
			\paragraph{}\ \ Lake Sain-Thomason is a fourth year software engineering student. After his sophomore year at SOU, he transferred to OIT to pursue a higher education. He is familiar with many languages such as C\#, C++, Java, C, and Obj-C. 
			
			\paragraph{}\ \ Robert Mooers has three years of programming experience, having primarily used C, C++, C\#, Java, Python, and QML. Robert is also proficient in graphics design, with experience in photo editing and vector graphics.
			
		\subsection{Prior Release}
			\paragraph{}\ \ There have been no prior releases at the time this document was written.
	\section{Major Subsystems}
		\paragraph{}\ \ This application is comprised of three major subsystems, the progressive web app client, the server, and the database. The progressive web app client will contain the user interface, and interact with the user. Individual games will be played within the client, and the results and statistical data will be sent to the server. The server will accept messages from clients including state, and will respond with the next action required for the client. The database will be used to hold user data and game information.
			
	\section{Relation of System to Existing System(s)}
		\paragraph{}\ \ ‘To the Rescue!’ will use libraries packaged with the ASP.NET Model View Controller framework. We intend on using open source/free images, Windows Voice Recorder for audio and open source/free audio clips.
	\section{Hardware Platform Description}
		\paragraph{}\ \ Minimum Hardware Requirements for Google Chrome, the supported browser of ‘To the Rescue!’, is: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 or later and an Intel Pentium 4 processor or later that is SSE2 capable. Required internet speed for ‘To the Rescue!’ is 4Mbps or higher.
	\section{Software Platform Description}
		\paragraph{}\ \ ‘To the Rescue!’ will be tested and intended for the Google Chrome web browser, but should be able to run on any web browser.

	\newpage
	\section{Performance}
		\paragraph{}\ \ ‘To the Rescue!’ will run at 60 frames per second to provide smooth transitions between pages and silky movements of small characters. Older devices may experience a lower or choppy framerate that do not fit the hardware specifications. 
	
	\section{Reliability}
		\paragraph{}\ \ ‘To the Rescue’ will try to maintain 95\% reliability for up to 30 concurrent users. It is important that users are able to rely on the application functioning properly, but the server may unexpectedly go down. Thus, 95\% reliability is reasonable. If more than 30 users use the application concurrently, the application will become less reliable.
	\section{Data Description}
		\paragraph{}\ \ ‘To the Rescue!’ will be serving web pages, including images, audio, and JavaScript. Data will be transferred from the database and to the database through an internet connection. The transfer rate will be 4 Mbps with a maximum page load time of 2 seconds.
	\section{Security and Safety}
		\paragraph{}\ \ All passwords will be encrypted before being sent off to the database, and users are logged out when the application is closed. 
	\section{Constraints}
		\paragraph{}\ \ 'To The Rescue!' content will be based on the Oregon State Common Core Standards for Kindergarten.
\chapter{User Profiles}	
	\paragraph{}\ \ The users of this software will be parents who create accounts for their children and the children use the application. The target users are children at a preschool and kindergarten learning level.
